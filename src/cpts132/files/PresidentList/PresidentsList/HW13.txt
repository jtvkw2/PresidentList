Homework 13 - Presidents
Challenge Level

1. I started with parsing the file and holding the contents of each line in an ArrayList

2. I added extra functionality to add and sort any number similar files, the worst thing is the time complexity having
   to loop through the array multiple times for the final result

3. I learned a lot about sorting an array of strings and converting sections to integers for easy sorting

4. Next time I would read through the assignment more thoroughly so I wouldn't implement features I don't need like the
    ability to add multiple files on the command line
